# CS50 AI & Machine Learning - Week 1

## Topics Covered:
- Logic and Knowledge Representation
- Propositional Logic
- Model Checking
- Logical Inference using `knowledge` base

---

## Projects

### 1. Knights

**Goal**: Use propositional logic to determine which characters (A, B, C) are Knights (always tell the truth) or Knaves (always lie) based on a set of logical statements.

**Key Concepts**:
- Symbolic logic and propositional expressions
- Building a knowledge base using logical operators
- Model checking using truth tables

**How to Run**:
  bash python logic.py


Minesweeper AI

### Objective  
Build an AI agent to play Minesweeper using logical inference to identify safe cells and mines.

### Concepts Covered  
- Propositional Logic  
- Constraint Satisfaction  
- Logical Inference  
- Updating Knowledge Base  

### How It Works  
- The AI tracks known safe cells and mines.  
- After every move, it updates its knowledge base with new clues.  
- It infers safe moves or mines from the knowledge base.  
- If no safe move exists, the AI guesses randomly.
