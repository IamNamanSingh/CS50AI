## Topics Covered:
- Heredity
- PageRank

## Projects

### 1. Heredity

**Goal:**  
Use Bayesian networks to model heredity and infer probabilities of having certain traits based on family data.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Bayesian networks and probabilistic reasoning  
- Conditional probabilities and joint distributions  
- Using Bayes' theorem to update beliefs  
- Representing genetic inheritance patterns with probabilistic models

**How to Run:**  
Run the heredity Python scripts to input family data and compute the probability of traits in descendants.

### 2. PageRank

**Goal:**  
Implement the PageRank algorithm to rank webpages based on their link structure.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Markov chains and random walks  
- Damping factor and probability of teleportation  
- Transition matrices and steady-state distributions  
- Iterative methods to compute PageRank scores

**How to Run:**  
Run the PageRank Python scripts on a sample web graph to output ranking scores of webpages.

## Summary

In Week 2, you’ll dive deeper into probabilistic models with **Heredity**, learning to reason under uncertainty with Bayesian networks. Then you’ll explore **PageRank**, a fundamental algorithm used by search engines to rank webpages, understanding the power of probability in graph-based algorithms.
