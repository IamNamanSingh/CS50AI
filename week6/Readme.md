## Projects

### 1. Parser

**Goal:**  
Build a syntax parser that uses a context-free grammar to analyze English sentence structure and identify noun phrases using recursive descent parsing.

**Key Concepts:**
- Writing context-free grammar (CFG) rules
- Recursive descent parsing
- Sentence tokenization and preprocessing
- Identification of syntactic components like noun phrases

**How to Run:**
```bash
python parser.py sentences.txt
