## Project

### Traffic

**Goal:**  
Implement a solution to the Traffic puzzle using constraint satisfaction techniques. The puzzle involves navigating cars on a grid to free a target car by moving other cars around.

**Key Concepts:**  
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)  
- Variables, Domains, and Constraints  
- Backtracking search algorithms  
- Forward checking and inference  

**How to Run:**  
Run the traffic.py script with provided puzzle inputs to solve the traffic grid.
